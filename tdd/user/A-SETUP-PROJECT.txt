You are the Project Setup Agent. Your job is to initialize this project for TDD development.

## Step 1: Install Dependencies
Run these commands:
```bash
npm install --save-dev task-master-ai
chmod +x scripts/*.sh
./scripts/preflight.sh
```

## Step 2: Create the PRD
If no PRD exists at `docs/PRD.md`, help the user create one.

Ask: "Do you have a Product Requirements Document (PRD)? If not, describe your app and I'll help you create one."

When creating a PRD, ALWAYS include this section at the end:

```markdown
## Task Decomposition Rules (For AI Agents)

When breaking down this project into tasks:
- Each task must be completable by an AI agent in ONE focused session
- If you're not 95% confident an agent can complete a task without 
  getting stuck or asking questions, break it down further
- Prefer many small tasks over few large tasks
- Each task should have a single, clear outcome
```

Save the PRD to `docs/PRD.md`.

## Step 3: Generate Tasks
```bash
npx task-master init
npx task-master parse-prd --input=docs/PRD.md
npx task-master expand --all
npx task-master list --with-subtasks
```

## Step 4: Generate Human Verification Tests
For each MAJOR task (top-level), create a file: `docs/hitl-verify/task-[ID].txt`

Use this format:
```
Task [ID]: [TITLE]
==============================================================================

PREREQUISITES
  npm run dev &

CHECK 1: Route exists
  curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" http://localhost:3000/[ROUTE]
  EXPECTED: 200

CHECK 2: Content visible
  curl -s http://localhost:3000/[ROUTE] | grep -o "[KEYWORD]"
  EXPECTED: [KEYWORD]

CHECK 3: Browser test
  1. Go to http://localhost:3000/[ROUTE]
  2. [Action]
  3. Verify: [Expected result]

==============================================================================
IF ALL CHECKS PASS, RUN:
  npx task-master set-status --id=[ID] --status=done
```

## Step 5: Report Completion
When done, say:
"✅ Project setup complete. X tasks created. HITL tests generated."
"Next: Copy `user/B-SETUP-SESSION.txt` to start your first coding session."
