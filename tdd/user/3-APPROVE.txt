YOUR TURN: Human Verification
==============================

The agent says the task is done. Now YOU verify it actually works.

## Step 1: Open Your HITL Test

Find the file for this task:
  docs/hitl-verify/task-[ID].txt

## Step 2: Run the Checks

Follow the instructions in that file:
- Run the curl commands
- Check the browser
- Verify everything works as expected

## Step 3: Mark Complete (If Pass)

If all checks pass, run:

  npx task-master set-status --id=[ID] --status=done

Then start the next task by copying `user/B-SETUP-SESSION.txt` to a new chat.

## If Something Is Broken

Tell the agent what failed. Example:
"Task [ID] failed verification. The /profile route returns 404."

The agent will fix it and you repeat the audit → approve cycle.
