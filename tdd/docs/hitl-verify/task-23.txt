# Audit Process Reform and Runtime Verification Protocols (Task 23)

## Description
Update project documentation to mandate runtime verification for all future task audits, ensuring the application builds, starts, and serves valid responses before approval.

## Pre-requisites
- None

## Verification Checklist

[ ] Review `AUDITOR.md` for the new mandatory runtime checks.
[ ] Run the `scripts/pre-audit-check.sh` on the current main branch to ensure the current state passes.
[ ] Manually verify `npm run dev` starts successfully.
[ ] Navigate to the Dashboard, Kanban, and Settings pages to verify they load (HTTP 200).
[ ] Introduce a deliberate syntax error and verify the audit check script fails.

## If Pass
Mark task as done in task-master.
