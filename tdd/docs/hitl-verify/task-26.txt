# Implement End-to-End Testing Suite with Playwright (Task 26)

## Description
Set up and configure Playwright to run browser-based E2E tests verifying application startup, core route navigation, authentication flows, and UI interactivity like theme toggling.

## Pre-requisites
- Tasks 22, 24, 25 completed

## Verification Checklist

[ ] Local Execution: Run `npm run test:e2e` and confirm all tests pass in headless mode.
[ ] Visual Verification: Run `npx playwright test --ui` to visually inspect the browser interactions during test execution.
[ ] Theme Logic: Specifically verify that the theme toggle test fails if the class name does not update on the `html` element.
[ ] Mock Integration: Confirm tests pass without a running PostgreSQL container, validating the integration with Task 25.

## If Pass
Mark task as done in task-master.
