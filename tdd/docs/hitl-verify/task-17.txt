# Build Job Aggregation System with TypeScript Scrapers and Geocoding (Task 17)

## Description
Implement automated job scraping from Indeed, LinkedIn, and company career pages using TypeScript functions (replacing n8n), integrate Google Maps Geocoding API for location processing, persist scraped data to the PostgreSQL database using Prisma, and integrate the real data feed into the /jobs UI.

## Verification Instructions

### 1. Prerequisites Setup

**A. Check what's already running**
```bash
docker ps --format "table {{.Names}}\t{{.Ports}}" | grep -E "redis|db|postgres"
```
*If you see `jobsearch-db` or similar on port 5435, the DB is already running. Skip to Redis.*

**B. Start Redis (if not running)**
```bash
cd ~/code/jobs/job-search-platform
docker compose up -d redis
```
*Success: Container starts or says "already running".*

**C. Prepare Database (Migrate & Seed)**
```bash
cd ~/code/jobs/job-search-platform
npx prisma migrate dev
npx prisma db seed
```
*Success: You see "The seed command has been executed."*

### 2. Verify Logic & Database (Automated)
```bash
cd ~/code/jobs/job-search-platform
npm test -- job-scrapers.test.ts job-service.test.ts
```
**Success:** Green checkmarks and "Pass".

### 3. Verify UI Display (Manual)
```bash
cd ~/code/jobs/job-search-platform
npm run dev
```

Once "Ready", open browser to: **http://localhost:3000/jobs**

**Checklist:**
- [ ] See a list of job cards?
- [ ] See titles like **"AI Developer"** or **"Sales Engineering"**?
- [ ] See **"Found 51 jobs"** (or similar count)?

### 4. Verify Manual Trigger (Optional)
In a new terminal:
```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/trigger-aggregation
```
**Success:** Returns success message. Server terminal shows "Aggregation completed".

## If Pass
Mark task as done in task-master.
