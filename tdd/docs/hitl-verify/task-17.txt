# Build Job Aggregation System with TypeScript Scrapers and Geocoding (Task 17)

## Description
Implement automated job scraping from Indeed, LinkedIn, and company career pages using TypeScript functions (replacing n8n), integrate Google Maps Geocoding API for location processing, persist scraped data to the PostgreSQL database using Prisma, and integrate the real data feed into the /jobs UI.

## Pre-requisites
- Redis running (for geocoding cache)
- Google Maps API key configured in `.env`
- Database migrated and seeded

## Verification Instructions

### 1. Verify Logic & Database (Automated)
Run these test commands to confirm the scrapers, geocoding, and database saving logic work correctly:

```bash
cd ~/code/jobs/job-search-platform
npm test -- job-scrapers.test.ts job-service.test.ts
```
**Success Criteria:** You should see green checkmarks and "Pass".

### 2. Verify UI Display (Manual)
Start the application server to visually check the data:

```bash
# In ~/code/jobs/job-search-platform
npm run dev
```

Once the server says "Ready", open your browser to:
**[http://localhost:3000/jobs](http://localhost:3000/jobs)**

**What to check:**
- [ ] Do you see a list of job cards?
- [ ] Do you see titles like **"AI Developer"** or **"Sales Engineering"**? (These were seeded).
- [ ] Does the page say something like **"Found 51 jobs"**?

### 3. Verify Manual Trigger (Optional)
While the server is still running, open a **new terminal tab** and trigger the scraper manually:

```bash
curl -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/admin/trigger-aggregation
```

**Success Criteria:**
- The command should return a success message.
- Look at the **first terminal** (where `npm run dev` is running) — you should see logs saying "Starting job aggregation run..." and then "Aggregation completed".

## If Pass
Mark task as done in task-master.
