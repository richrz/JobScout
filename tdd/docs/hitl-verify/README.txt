# Human-in-the-Loop Verification

This folder contains YOUR verification checklists - one per major task.

## How to Use

1. After the QA agent finishes its audit, open the file for that task:
   e.g., `task-14.txt`

2. Run the prerequisite commands (usually `npm run dev`).

3. Copy-paste each CHECK command into your terminal.

4. Do the browser test yourself.

5. If everything passes, run the "IF PASS" command at the bottom.

## Who Creates These Files?

These are generated by the Test Architect agent during project setup.
See: `user/1-setup/3-generate-my-checklists.txt`

## Why This Exists

Agents can lie. Unit tests can pass while the app is broken.
You are the final gate. If YOU can't reach the feature, it's not done.
