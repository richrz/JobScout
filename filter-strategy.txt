Research Plan (fast scanning, no code)

Resume tone & ATS: search “resume tone formal vs conversational”, “ATS friendly resume language”, “resume buzzwords credibility research”; skim Muse, Ladders, Indeed, SHRM.
Industry voice patterns: search “legal resume writing style”, “consultant resume impact statements”, “teacher resume tone”, “hospitality resume customer focus”.
Psychology of impression management: search “self-enhancement vs honesty resumes”, “power verbs credibility study”, “concreteness vs vagueness hiring research”.
Keyword strategy: search “resume keyword stuffing risk”, “job description alignment resume”.
Templates vs narrative: search “functional vs chronological resume when to use”, “STAR bullet examples resume”.
Control Model (3–4 simple dropdowns + presets)

Tone/Directness: Literal | Balanced | Assertive | Conversational. (Controls how hard claims are pushed.)
Brevity/Detail: Concise | Standard | Rich Detail. (Controls bullet length/context.)
Creativity/Spin: Strict Facts | Mild Framing | Creative Framing (no fabrication, but connects dots boldly).
Industry Jargon: None | Light | Heavy. (Controls jargon density and role-specific vocabulary.)
Optional fifth if needed: Formality: Formal | Neutral | Casual (can fold into Tone if keeping to 4).
Safety/Trust Guardrails

Always-on honesty: prohibit unverifiable claims; require evidence nouns (metrics, tools, clients).
Keyword discipline: “Natural keywords” vs “ATS-heavy” toggle to avoid stuffing.
Impact vs Duty: slider to favor achievements over responsibilities.
Quantification: Auto/Prompt user/Never—controls insertion of numbers when provided.
Presets (pre-fill dropdowns, user can tweak)

Attorney: Tone Formal, Brevity Standard, Creativity Strict, Jargon Heavy, Impact high on outcomes/precedent.
IT Consultant: Tone Balanced, Brevity Concise, Creativity Mild, Jargon Light/Heavy toggle, Keywords ATS-heavy.
Teacher: Tone Warm Balanced, Brevity Standard, Creativity Mild, Jargon Light (education terms), Impact on outcomes & community.
Hospitality/Retail: Tone Conversational Balanced, Brevity Concise, Creativity Mild, Jargon Light, Impact on customer metrics.
Real Estate: Tone Assertive, Brevity Standard, Creativity Creative, Jargon Medium, Impact on sales/negotiation wins.
How to present to users (non-technical)

Show 3–4 dropdowns with short helper text and example bullet preview that updates live.
Include a “Safe Mode” toggle (strict facts + concise + light jargon) and “Standout Mode” (assertive + richer detail + creative framing) to reduce decision fatigue.
Let users pick a preset, tweak sliders, and see 2–3 sample bullets before generating the full resume.

Persona Configuration.

1. Revert to Clean Slate
I will first undo the previous "Authentic/Professional/Persuasive" changes to restore the codebase to a neutral state, as requested.

2. The "Resume Persona" System (Proposed Solution)
Instead of a single "Strategy" dropdown, I will implement three distinct controls that allow users to "dial in" the AI's personality. This matches the user's request for "3-4 category drop down boxes" to handle different industries (Attorney vs. Burger Flipper).

Control A: Tone & Style (The "Who am I?" Control)
Standard (Corporate): [Default] Balanced, professional, safe. Good for Admin, Management, General.
Formal (Legal/Academic): Factual, dense, prestigious words, no fluff. Good for Law, Academia, Government.
Modern (Tech/Startup): Action-oriented, skills-heavy, scannable. Good for IT, Engineering, Startups.
Creative (Design/Marketing): Expressive, narrative-driven, showcases personality. Good for Arts, Marketing, Media.
Control B: Creativity Level (The "Lying" Control)
Literal: Stick strictly to the provided text. Fix grammar only.
Enhanced: Optimize phrasing and keywords, but keep the core meaning.
Strategic: Infer skills and aggressively reframe experience (the "taking liberties" option).
Control C: Verbosity (The "Length" Control)
Concise: Short, punchy bullet points.
Balanced: Standard 1-2 sentence descriptions.
Detailed: Comprehensive storytelling and context.
Implementation Plan
Modify 
ResumeBuilder.tsx
: Replace the single "AI Strategy" dropdown with a Pop-over / Settings Menu (or a row of 3 smaller selects) labeled "AI Settings".
Update 
llm.ts
: Rewrite the prompt generation logic to combine these three parameters into a complex system prompt.
Example: "You are writing a [Tone] resume. Use a [Creativity] approach to the facts. Output [Verbosity] bullet points."
Update 
types/llm.ts
: Define these new enums.
This allows an Attorney to pick: Formal + Literal + 
Detailed
. A Tech Consultant might pick: Modern + Strategic + Concise.

Shall I proceed with implementing this 3-Axis Resume Persona System?

  Proposed Model: 
  4-Dimensional Control 
  System

  Your current 3-tier system
  (Authentic/Professional/Per
  suasive) conflates multiple
   dimensions. Here's an
  orthogonal 4-axis model:

  Axis 1: VOICE (Formality 
  Spectrum)

  Question: "How should I 
  sound?"

  | Level | Label        |
  Description
               | Temperature
  Effect |
  |-------|--------------|---
  ---------------------------
  -----------|---------------
  -----|
  | 1     | Casual       |
  Startup/creative energy,
  conversational | +0.1
           |
  | 2     | Professional |
  Standard business tone
  (default)        | 0
             |
  | 3     | Buttoned-Up  |
  Conservative, formal
  language           | -0.1
               |

  Examples:
  - Casual: "Built a killer
  analytics dashboard that
  saved the team 20
  hours/week"
  - Professional: "Developed
  analytics dashboard
  reducing team workload by
  20 hours weekly"
  - Buttoned-Up: "Architected
   enterprise analytics
  solution, achieving 20-hour
   weekly efficiency gain
  across department"

  Best for:
  - Casual → Startups,
  creative agencies, tech
  companies with casual
  culture
  - Professional → Most
  corporate roles, mid-market
   companies
  - Buttoned-Up → Law firms,
  finance, government,
  healthcare, executive roles

  ---
  Axis 2: DENSITY (Content 
  Volume)

  Question: "How much 
  detail?"

  | Level | Label         |
  Words/Bullet | Bullets/Job
  | Total Resume |
  |-------|---------------|--
  ------------|-------------|
  --------------|
  | 1     | Punchy        |
  10-14        | 2-4
  | ~300 words   |
  | 2     | Balanced      |
  15-20        | 4-6
  | ~450 words   |
  | 3     | Comprehensive |
  20-30        | 5-8
  | ~600+ words  |

  Examples:
  - Punchy: "Led team of 5.
  Delivered $2M project on
  time."
  - Balanced: "Led
  cross-functional team of 5
  engineers delivering $2M
  infrastructure project on
  schedule and under budget."
  - Comprehensive: "Directed
  cross-functional team of 5
  senior engineers through
  complete infrastructure
  modernization initiative
  valued at $2M, delivering
  ahead of schedule while
  maintaining 15% budget
  surplus through strategic
  vendor negotiations."

  Best for:
  - Punchy → Entry-level,
  service industry, career
  changers, busy hiring
  markets
  - Balanced → Most
  mid-career professionals
  - Comprehensive → Executive
   roles, technical depth
  requirements, specialized
  positions

  Axis 3: LICENSE (Creative 
  Latitude)

  Question: "How much can I 
  enhance?"

  | Level | Label      |
  Behavior
            | Risk Level |
  |-------|------------|-----
  ---------------------------
  ------|------------|
  | 1     | Just Facts | Only
   explicitly stated
  information   | None
  |
  | 2     | Polish Up  |
  Standard professional
  enhancement    | Low
   |
  | 3     | Sell Hard  |
  Aggressive reframing, skill
   bridging | Medium     |

  Examples (same raw input: 
  "helped with customer 
  emails"):
  - Just Facts: "Responded to
   customer email inquiries"
  - Polish Up: "Managed
  customer communications,
  resolving inquiries and
  maintaining satisfaction"
  - Sell Hard: "Spearheaded
  customer success
  initiatives, transforming
  routine communications into
   relationship-building
  opportunities that drove
  retention"

  Best for:
  - Just Facts → Government,
  compliance roles,
  background-check-heavy
  positions, risk-averse
  users
  - Polish Up → Standard
  applications, honest
  enhancement (default)
  - Sell Hard → Competitive
  markets, career pivots,
  underqualified
  applications, "cover all
  bases" scenarios

  ---
  Axis 4: INSIDER (Domain 
  Expertise Signaling)

  Question: "How technical 
  should I sound?"

  | Level | Label          |
  Jargon Use
     | Acronym Handling
    |
  |-------|----------------|-
  ---------------------------
  ---|-----------------------
  --|

  Key terminology, ATS
  keywords | Standard
  acronyms OK    |
  | 3     | Deep Insider   |
  Full technical vocabulary
     | Assume reader
  knowledge |

  Examples:

  Prompt Injection by Axis

  Voice modifiers:
  - Casual: "Write in a
  conversational, energetic
  tone. Use contractions. Be
  personable."
  - Professional: "Maintain
  standard business
  communication tone."
  - Buttoned-Up: "Use formal
  language. Avoid
  contractions. Employ
  sophisticated vocabulary."

  Density modifiers:
  - Punchy: "Keep bullets to
  10-14 words. One key
  achievement per bullet.
  Maximum impact, minimum
  words."
  - Balanced: "Aim for 15-20
  words per bullet. Include
  context and results."
  - Comprehensive: "Provide
  full context in 20-30
  words. Include methodology,
   scope, and impact."

  License modifiers:
  - Just Facts: "ONLY include
   information explicitly
  provided. NO inference. NO
  embellishment. If
  information is missing,
  omit it."
  - Polish Up:
  "Professionally enhance
  descriptions using standard
   business language.
  Reasonable inference
  allowed."
  - Sell Hard: "Aggressively
  reframe experience to match
   job requirements. Bridge
  transferable skills
  creatively. Maximize impact
   language."

  Insider modifiers:
  - Plain English: "Avoid
  jargon. Explain any
  technical terms. Write for
  a general audience."
  - Industry-Aware: "Use
  standard industry
  terminology. Include ATS
  keywords from job
  description."
  - Deep Insider: "Use full
  technical vocabulary.
  Assume reader has domain
  expertise. Include specific
   tools, frameworks,
  methodologies."

  ---
  Alternative Model: 3 Axes 
  (Simplified)

  If 4 feels like too many,
  you could merge Voice +
  Density into one "Style"
  axis:

  3-Axis Model

  1. Style: Punchy-Casual →
  Balanced-Professional →
  Comprehensive-Formal
  2. Honesty: Literal →
  Enhanced → Aggressive
  3. Expertise: Accessible →
  Technical

  This trades granularity for
   simplicity. A senior
  attorney might want
  Comprehensive (detailed)
  but not Casual, which the
  merged model doesn't handle
   well.

  ---
  Additional Considerations

  Action Verb Ladders by 
  Level

  Based on the research
  (https://greatresumesfast.c
  om/blog/how-do-i-use-action
  -verbs-in-my-resume/, https
  ://blog.theinterviewguys.co
  m/resume-action-verbs/):

  | Career Level | Verbs to
  Use
             | Verbs to Avoid
                 |
  |--------------|-----------
  ---------------------------
  ----------|----------------
  --------------|
  | Entry        |
  Contributed, Supported,
  Assisted, Learned      |
  Spearheaded, Transformed
    |
  | Mid          |
  Implemented, Managed,
  Developed, Led           |
  Responsible for, Worked
  with |
  | Senior       | Directed,
  Established, Pioneered,
  Orchestrated | Helped,
  Participated         |

  You could add a 5th axis 
  for career level that
  adjusts verb selection, or
  infer it from the profile
  data.

  Metrics Focus

  Some users might want to
  control how aggressively
  the AI quantifies results:
  - Narrative: Story-focused
  descriptions
  - Balanced: Mix of
  qualitative and
  quantitative
  - Metrics-Heavy: Numbers
  everywhere possible

  ---
  My Recommendation

  Go with the 4-axis model
  with these specific names:

  1. 🎭 Tone (Casual /
  Professional / Formal)
  2. 📏 Detail (Punchy /
  Balanced / Comprehensive)
  3. ✨ Enhancement (Factual
  / Polished / Persuasive)
  4. 🔧 Terminology
  (Accessible / Standard /
  Technical)

  Plus an industry preset 
  dropdown that sets
  intelligent defaults.

  This gives you:
  - 81 unique combinations
  (3×3×3×3) for fine-grained
  control
  - Clear mental models for
  each axis
  - Industry presets for
  users who don't want to
  think about it
  - Orthogonal dimensions
  that don't conflict with
  each other

  ---

● ---
  Summary

  Your current system
  (Authentic/Professional/Per
  suasive) mixes
  creativity/honesty with
  tone and verbosity. The
  4-axis model separates
  these into independent
  controls:

  | Your Original | Becomes

                    | Why


            |
  |---------------|----------
  ---------------------------
  ------------------|--------
  ---------------------------
  ---------------------------
  ----------|
  | Authentic     |
  License=Factual +
  Tone=Professional
           | Separates
  "truthfulness" from "style"

         |
  | Professional  |
  License=Polished + default
  everything
  | The middle ground

                     |
  | Persuasive    |
  License=Persuasive +
  possible Tone/Detail
  adjustments | Allows
  aggressive + formal
  (attorney) or aggressive +
  casual (startup) |

  The key insight: An
  attorney needs formal tone
  + factual content +
  technical jargon. A startup
   founder needs casual tone
  + persuasive content +
  technical jargon. Your
  current system can't
  distinguish these because
  it conflates dimensions.

  Want me to mock up the UI
  component or write the
  updated LLM prompt
  modifiers for this model?
********************************************
I have completed the research and have a new, robust plan for the Resume Persona Configuration.

1. Revert to Clean Slate
I will first undo the previous "Authentic/Professional/Persuasive" changes to restore the codebase to a neutral state, as requested.

2. The "Resume Persona" System (Proposed Solution)
Instead of a single "Strategy" dropdown, I will implement three distinct controls that allow users to "dial in" the AI's personality. This matches the user's request for "3-4 category drop down boxes" to handle different industries (Attorney vs. Burger Flipper).

Control A: Tone & Style (The "Who am I?" Control)
Standard (Corporate): [Default] Balanced, professional, safe. Good for Admin, Management, General.
Formal (Legal/Academic): Factual, dense, prestigious words, no fluff. Good for Law, Academia, Government.
Modern (Tech/Startup): Action-oriented, skills-heavy, scannable. Good for IT, Engineering, Startups.
Creative (Design/Marketing): Expressive, narrative-driven, showcases personality. Good for Arts, Marketing, Media.
Control B: Creativity Level (The "Lying" Control)
Literal: Stick strictly to the provided text. Fix grammar only.
Enhanced: Optimize phrasing and keywords, but keep the core meaning.
Strategic: Infer skills and aggressively reframe experience (the "taking liberties" option).
Control C: Verbosity (The "Length" Control)
Concise: Short, punchy bullet points.
Balanced: Standard 1-2 sentence descriptions.
Detailed: Comprehensive storytelling and context.
Implementation Plan
Modify 
ResumeBuilder.tsx
: Replace the single "AI Strategy" dropdown with a Pop-over / Settings Menu (or a row of 3 smaller selects) labeled "AI Settings".
Update 
llm.ts
: Rewrite the prompt generation logic to combine these three parameters into a complex system prompt.
Example: "You are writing a [Tone] resume. Use a [Creativity] approach to the facts. Output [Verbosity] bullet points."
Update 
types/llm.ts
: Define these new enums.
This allows an Attorney to pick: Formal + Literal + 
Detailed
. A Tech Consultant might pick: Modern + Strategic + Concise.
