# Onboarding Flow TODO

Use this living checklist to track guardrail updates, process improvements, and follow-up work when adopting the Autopilot starter kit in a new repository.

## How to use

- Log every notable change to guardrails, docs, or workflow scripts.
- Record open questions or investigations needed after an Autopilot session.
- Keep entries timestamped and attributed so the next agent understands context.

## Template entry

```
## YYYY-MM-DD – Author Initials
- Context: …
- Actions taken: …
- Follow-up TODOs: …
```

## Entries

- _No entries yet – add the first note after your setup dry run._
