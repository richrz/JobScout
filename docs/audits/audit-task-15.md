# Audit Report: Task 15 - Master Profile Builder

**Date:** Wednesday, November 19, 2025
**Auditor:** Gemini (Session ID: ded08bd)
**Builder:** (Previous Agent)
**Status:** 🔴 **NON-COMPLIANT (FAIL)**

## 1. Verification Summary

| Check | Status | Notes |
|-------|--------|-------|
| **Automated Tests** | ❌ FAIL | Critical tests for GPT-4 Vision, Rich Text Editor, and Auto-Save are missing or only test mocked behavior. |
| **Implementation Completeness** | ❌ FAIL | GPT-4 Vision is mocked. Rich Text Editor is a placeholder. Multi-section form is incomplete. |
| **Code Quality** | ⚠️ PARTIAL | Good structure but some typing could be improved. |
| **Functionality** | ❌ FAIL | Core functionalities like resume parsing and rich text editing are not functional. |

## 2. Detailed Findings

### ❌ Critical Violations
-   **GPT-4 Vision Mocked:** The `src/lib/resume-parser.ts` implementation for GPT-4 Vision is entirely mocked, providing no actual OCR or API integration. This is a critical failure as it contradicts the core requirement of the task.
-   **Missing Rich Text Editor:** The `RichTextEditor` in `src/components/profile/ProfileBuilder.tsx` is a non-functional placeholder, rendering the rich text editing feature entirely absent.
-   **Incomplete Form Structure:** The `ProfileBuilder.tsx` component only implements the "Work History" section, leaving "Education", "Skills", "Projects", and "Certifications" as unimplemented sections.
-   **Lack of Comprehensive Testing:** Critical test files (`tests/unit/components/profile/ProfileBuilder.test.tsx`, `tests/unit/lib/resume-parser.test.ts`) either have minimal coverage or only test mocked components, failing to validate actual functionality.

### ⚠️ Major Gaps
-   **Untyped Data Structures:** The `Profile` interface in `src/lib/profile-utils.ts` uses `any[]` for several fields (`workHistory`, `education`, `projects`, `certifications`), which reduces type safety and maintainability.
-   **Missing Features:** JSON export functionality, skill tag input, and dynamic education entry forms are not clearly implemented or visible in the provided code.

### ✅ Strengths
-   **Progress Calculation:** The `calculateCompleteness` function in `src/lib/profile-utils.ts` is well-implemented and adequately tested.
-   **Code Organization:** The overall file structure and separation of concerns are generally good.

## 3. Auditor Recommendations
The task is not ready for completion and requires significant further development and testing.

**Required Actions:**
1.  **Implement GPT-4 Vision:** Replace the mocked `parseResume` function with actual API calls and OCR logic.
2.  **Integrate Tiptap Editor:** Implement the `RichTextEditor` component using Tiptap and integrate it correctly into the profile sections.
3.  **Complete Form Sections:** Fully implement all remaining sections (Education, Skills, Projects, Certifications) with dynamic input forms.
4.  **Add Comprehensive Tests:** Write thorough unit and integration tests for the GPT-4 Vision parsing, Rich Text Editor, auto-save, and all form interactions.
5.  **Refine Types:** Improve type definitions in `profile-utils.ts` for profile sub-sections.

## 4. Verdict
**AUDIT FAILED.** The task is non-compliant and requires extensive remediation.
