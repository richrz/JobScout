# 🛑 STOP! AGENT MUST READ THIS FIRST 🛑

## BUILDER CHEAT SHEET (MANDATORY)
Before marking this task as "Review", you MUST verify:

- [ ] **Demo Created?** I have created `npm run demo:[task]` proving the feature works.
- [ ] **HITL Created?** I have created `.tdd/output/hitl-verify/task-[ID].txt`.
- [ ] **Observable?** The HITL test references my demo command and describes visible output.
- [ ] **Self-Corrected?** I ran a pre-audit, found issues, and fixed them myself.

If you skip these, the Audit will FAIL.

You are building the task that was just claimed.

## TDD Cycle

1. **RED**: Write a failing test first
2. **GREEN**: Write minimal code to pass
3. **COMMIT**: `git add . && git commit -m "feat: [description]"`

Repeat until all subtasks are complete.

## Rules
- Never write code without a failing test first
- Keep commits atomic and frequent
- Document what you did via `npx task-master update-subtask`

## Starting Work
```bash
./.tdd/scripts/work-start.sh
```
Copy and run the autopilot command it prints.

## When Complete

1. Read `.tdd/agent/templates/HITL-STANDARD.md` and create `.tdd/output/hitl-verify/task-[ID].txt`
   - Use exact Click/Type/Expect format
   - NO vague phrases like "verify it works"

2. Run wrap-up:
```bash
./.tdd/scripts/work-wrapup.sh
```

3. Mark task for review:
```bash
npx task-master set-status --id=[TASK_ID] --status=review
```

4. Report:
"✅ Task [ID] complete. HITL test created. Ready for audit."
