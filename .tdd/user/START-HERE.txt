Welcome to TDD-in-a-Box. This kit helps you build software with AI agents while keeping YOU in control.

## Quick Reference

📁 You are in: .tdd/user/
📋 This folder contains prompts you copy-paste to AI chats

## Your Workflow

### First Time Setup
Copy the contents of `A-SETUP-PROJECT.txt` to a NEW AI chat.
The agent will create your PRD and generate tasks.

### Each Coding Session
1. Copy `B-SETUP-SESSION.txt` to a NEW AI chat → Agent claims next task
2. Copy `1-BUILD.txt` to CONTINUE → Agent builds the feature
3. Copy `2-AUDIT.txt` to a NEW AI chat → Different agent verifies work
4. Open `3-APPROVE.txt` and do the checks YOURSELF → You approve

### The Golden Rule
NEVER let an AI mark a task "done". Only YOU can approve work after verifying it yourself.

## File Guide

| File | When to Use | Who Uses It |
|------|-------------|-------------|
| A-SETUP-PROJECT.txt | Once, at project start | You → AI |
| B-SETUP-SESSION.txt | Start of each coding session | You → AI |
| 1-BUILD.txt | After session setup | You → AI (same chat) |
| 2-AUDIT.txt | After build complete | You → NEW AI chat |
| 3-APPROVE.txt | After audit passes | YOU (no AI) |
