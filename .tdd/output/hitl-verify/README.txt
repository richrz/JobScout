# Human-in-the-Loop Verification

This folder contains YOUR verification checklists - one per major task.

## What These Files Are

Each file is a **User Acceptance Test (UAT)** that you complete by:
1. Following the steps exactly
2. Checking YES or NO for each test
3. Writing notes when things fail
4. Signing and dating when complete

## How to Use

### Before You Start
1. Open the file for the task you're verifying (e.g., `task-14.txt`)
2. Read the PREREQUISITES section
3. Run the startup command and wait for it to be ready

### For Each Test
1. Read the **PURPOSE** to understand what you're testing and why
2. Follow the **STEPS** exactly as written
3. Compare what you see to the **EXPECTED RESULT**
4. In the **VERIFICATION** section:
   - Check [X] YES if it matched
   - Check [X] NO if it didn't match
   - Write what happened instead if NO
   - Add any screenshots or notes

### When Complete
1. Fill in the **SUMMARY** section (count passed/failed)
2. Check overall PASS or FAIL
3. If PASS: Run the command provided to mark task done
4. If FAIL: Report the failures to the agent
5. Sign and date

## Why This Format?

This format creates a **documented verification record**:
- Shows exactly what was tested
- Records the actual results
- Creates an audit trail
- Helps reproduce issues
- Proves the feature works

## Who Creates These Files?

Generated by the Implementation Agent when they complete a task.
The Auditor Agent verifies the tests follow the standard format.
See `.tdd/agent/templates/HITL-STANDARD.md` for the full specification.

## The Golden Rule

**Agents can lie. Unit tests can pass while the app is broken.**
**You are the final gate. If YOU can't complete these tests, it's not done.**
